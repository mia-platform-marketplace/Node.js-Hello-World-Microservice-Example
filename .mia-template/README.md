## Summary

%CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SERVICE_DESCRIPTION%

## Local Development

To develop the service locally you need:

- Node 16+

To setup node, please if possible try to use [nvm][nvm], so you can manage
multiple versions easily. Once you have installed nvm, you can go inside
the directory of the project and simply run `nvm install`, the `.nvmrc` file
will install and select the correct version if you donâ€™t already have it.

Once you have all the dependency in place, you can launch:

```shell
npm ci
npm run coverage
```

This two commands, will install the dependencies and run the tests with
the coverage report that you can view as an HTML page in
`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.  
After running the coverage you can create your local copy of the default values
for the `env` variables needed for launching the application.

```shell
cp ./default.env ./local.env
```

From now on, if you want to change anyone of the default values for
the variables you can do it inside the `local.env` file without
pushing it to the remote repository.

Once you have all your dependency in place you can launch:

```shell
set -a && source local.env
npm start
```

After that you will have the service exposed on your machine. In order to verify that the service is working properly you could launch in another terminal shell:

```shell
curl http://localhost:3000/-/ready
```

As a result the terminal should return you the following message:

```json
{"name":"mia_template_service_name_placeholder","status":"OK","version":"0.1.0"}
```
